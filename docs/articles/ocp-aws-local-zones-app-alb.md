Let's talk about delivering single-digit millisecond latency applications to end-users on [OpenShift Cloud Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) clusters using [AWS Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones).

{% details Expand to know how to create Machines running in AWS Local Zones %} 

- ToDo

{% enddetails %}

AWS Local Zones were created to locate Cloud Infrastructure closer to the large cities and IT centers, helping businesses to deliver their solutions to end-users faster.

As always, you need to design your application architecture to take advantage of that feature without being limited or impacted negatively. So let's discuss some options to deploy your application using edge resources on Local Zones, avoidng requests being routed to other locations.

I will walk through the solution example which can rely on user-close infrastructure while describing the steps to create ingresses distributed between the big city-center networks, then deploy the application on the edge locations. Finally, I will deploy one intance of the "geo-app" (sample) application running in the nodes distributed on the edge, then run a few tests to collect the latency from different locations (users) to different zone groups (parent/main region and Local Zones).

## Summary<a name="summary"></a>

### User's story<a name="summ-users-story"></a>

- As a company with hybrid cloud architecture, I would like to process real-time machine learning models in AWS specialized instances closer to my application.
- As a Regional Bakery operating within the eastern US, I want to deliver custom cakes to the city where my customers are, advertising the closest stores with availability and an estimated delivery time.
- As a doctor depending on the telemedicine solutions, I would like to have fast results from the exams in order to make fast decisions in an emergency. Those kinds of systems demand ML processing with high computing power closer to the end users.

### What you need to know<a name="summ-what-you-need-know"></a>

- ALB will be available to install through OLM
- You can install the Operator from Source Code

Resources available to Local Zones are limited when compared to the parent region. For example, compute instances are very limited in terms of sizes and types, and for ELB only the Application Load Balancer is supported. The price is also not the same: when we look at the compute price of `c5d.2xlarge` in `NYC (New York)` it is 20% more expensive than the parent region, N. Virginia (`us-east-1`).

For that reason, itâ€™s important to make sure that your architecture will take advantage of running close to the users.

To go deeper into the details about the limitations and pricing, check the [Local Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/features/) and [EC2 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) page.

## Reference Architecture<a name="reference-arch"></a>

{% enddetails %}

{% details Quick steps to deploy the ALB Operator %}

## Install the Application Load Balancer Operator <a name="install-alb-oper"></a>

We will use the [Application Load Balancer Operator](https://github.com/openshift/aws-load-balancer-operator) to install the ALB Controller to be able to create ingress using the AWS Application Load Balancer. The installation will be performed from source, you can read more options on the project page.

> Note: if you dont want to build from source, or already deployed the ALB Operator, you can jump to the application deployment section. 

1. Setup Local Development: https://github.com/openshift/aws-load-balancer-operator#local-development
2. Follow the tutorial to install: https://github.com/openshift/aws-load-balancer-operator/blob/main/docs/tutorial.md

> Quick steps after build the operand and operator container images and exported to your registry:

```bash
# Create the project to place the operator
oc new-project aws-load-balancer-operator

# Make sure the AWS Access Key are exported
cat << EOF > credentials
[default]
aws_access_key_id=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
aws_secret_access_key=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
EOF

# Create the secret used to deploy the ALB
# NOTE: you should not use your credentials in
# shared clusters, please take a look into [CCO](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/installing/installing_aws/manually-creating-iam.html)
# to create the `CredentialsRequest` instead.
oc create secret generic aws-load-balancer-operator -n aws-load-balancer-operator \
--from-file=credentials=credentials

# Export the image name to be used
export IMG=quay.io/mrbraga/aws-load-balancer-operator:latest
# Build operator (...)
make deploy

oc get all -n aws-load-balancer-operator
```

3. Create the ALB Controller

```bash
cat <<EOF | envsubst | oc create -f -
apiVersion: networking.olm.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: AWSLoadBalancerController
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  subnetTagging: Manual
  ingressClass: cloud
  config:
    replicas: 2
  enabledAddons:
    - AWSShield
    - AWSWAFv2
EOF
```

Done! Make sure the `AWSLoadBalancerController` was created correctly.

```bash
oc get AWSLoadBalancerController cluster -o yaml
```

You should be able to see the subnetIds discovered by operator using the cluster tags, something like this:

```yaml
status:
(...)
  ingressClass: cloud
  subnets:
    internal:
    - subnet-01413cd7efad9178b
    - subnet-022f16980e77cc293
    - subnet-097b0dc75fc4fdc31
    - subnet-0be66875994175dee
    - subnet-0c0294c9de6751616
    subnetTagging: Manual
    tagged:
    - subnet-002c105e0bb598472
    - subnet-026977c5b3fb45435
    - subnet-0479f5a0434d84f85
    - subnet-05a634b3b37197f53
    - subnet-0e3bbcb042149a250
```

{% enddetails %}

## **Deploy the Application**

Now it's time for action! In this section we will deploy one sample application which will get the public `clientIp` (from HTTP request headers) and the `serverIp` (discovered when the app is initialized), returning it to the user.

The app is called `geo-app`, feel free to change it by setting those environment variables:

```bash
APP_NS=geo-app
APP_BASE_NAME=geo-app
```

Create the App Namespace:

```bash
cat <<EOF | envsubst | oc create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: ${APP_NS}
EOF
```

Create the deployment function:

```bash
create_deployment() {
  LOCATION=$1; shift
  AZ_NAME=$1; shift
  APP_NAME="${APP_BASE_NAME}-${LOCATION}"
  cat <<EOF | envsubst | oc create -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ${APP_NAME}
  namespace: ${APP_NS}
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ${APP_NAME}
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ${APP_NAME}
        zone_group: ${AZ_NAME::-1}
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        zone_group: ${AZ_NAME::-1}
      tolerations:
      - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/edge"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: ""
        effect: "NoSchedule"
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/mrbraga/go-geo-app:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: ${APP_NAME}
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: ${APP_NAME}
  namespace: ${APP_NS}
labels:
  zone_group: ${AZ_NAME::-1}
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8000
      protocol: TCP
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: ${APP_NAME}
EOF
}
```

Create the deployment for each:

```bash
create_deployment "nyc" "${AZ_NAME_NYC}"
create_deployment "mia" "${AZ_NAME_MIA}"
```

Make sure the application are running for each location:
- New York Local Zone resources

```bash
oc get pods -n ${APP_NS} -l zone_group=${AZ_GROUP_NYC} -o wide
oc get nodes -l topology.kubernetes.io/zone=${AZ_NAME_NYC}
```

- Miami Local Zone resources

```bash
oc get pods -n ${APP_NS} -l zone_group=${AZ_GROUP_MIA} -o wide
oc get nodes -l topology.kubernetes.io/zone=${AZ_NAME_MIA}
```

Create the ingress' function to setup the edge locations:

```bash
create_ingress() {
  LOCATION=$1; shift
  SUBNET=$1; shift
  APP_NAME=${APP_BASE_NAME}-${LOCATION}
  cat <<EOF | envsubst | oc create -f -
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-lz-${LOCATION}
  namespace: ${APP_NS}
  annotations:
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: instance
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/subnets: ${SUBNET}
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /healthz
  labels:
    location: ${LOCATION}
spec:
  ingressClassName: cloud
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Exact
            backend:
              service:
                name: ${APP_NAME}
                port:
                  number: 80

EOF
}
```

Create the ingress instances for each edge location:

```bash
create_ingress "nyc" "${SUBNET_ID_NYC_PUB}"
create_ingress "mia" "${SUBNET_ID_MIA_PUB}"
```

Finally, let's create an instance of the same application in the default zones within the parent region (`${REGION}`). Let's do it in an single script:

```bash
SUBNETS=(`aws ec2 describe-subnets \
  --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${CLUSTER_ID}-public-${REGION}a" \
  --query 'Subnets[].SubnetId' \
  --output text`)
SUBNETS+=(`aws ec2 describe-subnets \
  --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${CLUSTER_ID}-public-${REGION}b" \
  --query 'Subnets[].SubnetId' \
  --output text`)
SUBNETS+=(`aws ec2 describe-subnets \
  --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${CLUSTER_ID}-public-${REGION}c" \
  --query 'Subnets[].SubnetId' \
  --output text`)
SUBNET=$(echo ${SUBNETS[@]} |tr ' ' ',')

APP_NAME="${APP_BASE_NAME}-main"
ZONE_GROUP="${REGION}"

cat <<EOF | envsubst | oc create -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: ${APP_NAME}
  namespace: ${APP_NS}
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: ${APP_NAME}
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: ${APP_NAME}
        zone_group: ${ZONE_GROUP}
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/mrbraga/go-geo-app:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        name: ${APP_NAME}
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
---
apiVersion: v1

spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8000
      protocol: TCP
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: ${APP_NAME}
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-main
  namespace: ${APP_NS}
  annotations:
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: instance
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/subnets: ${SUBNET}
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-path: /healthz
  labels:
    location: ${ZONE_GROUP}
spec:
  ingressClassName: cloud
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: ${APP_NAME}
                port:
                  number: 80
EOF
```

Wait for the load balancers be provisioned and the `ADDRESS` is available:

```bash
oc get ingress -n ${APP_NS}
```

Get the Ingress' URL for each location:

```bash
APP_URL_MAIN=$(oc get ingress \
  -l location=${REGION} -n ${APP_NS} \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname} ')

APP_URL_NYC=$(oc get ingress \
  -l location=nyc -n ${APP_NS} \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname} ')

APP_URL_MIA=$(oc get ingress \
  -l location=mia -n ${APP_NS} \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname} ')
```

Make sure you can reach both deployments:

```bash
$ curl -s http://${APP_URL_MAIN}/ |jq .serverInfo.address
"3.233.82.41"

$ curl -s http://${APP_URL_MIA}/ |jq .serverInfo.address
"64.187.128.146"

$ curl -s http://${APP_URL_NYC}/ |jq .serverInfo.address
"15.181.162.164"
```

## **Test and Benchmark**

Now it's time to make some measurements with `curl`.

We've run tests from 3 different sources to measure the total time to 3 different targets/zone groups (NYC, MIA and parent region):
- Client#1's Location: FlorianÃ³polis/Brazil
- Client#2's Location: Digital Ocean/NYC3 (New York)
- Client#3's Location: Digital Ocean/SFN (San Francisco)

### Setup curl

Create the file `curl-format-all.txt`:
```bash
cat <<EOF> curl-format-all.txt
  time_namelookup:  %{time_namelookup} Sec\n
      time_connect:  %{time_connect} Sec\n
   time_appconnect:  %{time_appconnect} Sec\n
  time_pretransfer:  %{time_pretransfer} Sec\n
     time_redirect:  %{time_redirect} Sec\n
time_starttransfer:  %{time_starttransfer} Sec\n
                   ----------\n
        time_total:  %{time_total} Sec\n
EOF
```

Create the file `curl-format-table.txt` to return the attributes in an single-line tabulation format:

```bash
cat <<EOF> curl-format-table.txt
%{time_namelookup}   %{time_connect}     %{time_starttransfer}    %{time_total}
EOF
```

Create the functions used to test:

```bash
curl_all() {
  curl -w "@curl-format-all.txt" -o /dev/null -s ${1}
}

curl_table() {
  curl -w "@curl-format-table.txt" -o /dev/null -s ${1}
}
```

Also create the function to collect data points, it will send 10 requests, one by second:

```bash
curl_batch() {
  echo -e " \tTime\t\t\t    DNS\t       Connect\t   TTFB\t       Total\t  "
  for x in $(seq 1 10) ; do
    echo -ne "$(date)\t   $(curl_table "${1}")\n";
    sleep 1;
  done
}
```

### Testing from (`Client#1`) / Brazil

```
- Distance between Public IP of Client and Server:

> The Server's location is not precise, as the AWS' Public IP is not exactly from server's location, but the Parent's region. So the IP Address' location are the same between all locations (main region's zone and local zones), impacting in the real value of the calculation

```bash
$ curl -s ${APP_URL_NYC} |jq .distance

</td></tr></table>


Now we can see the advantage of operating in the edge delivering applications to a client's close to the server, some insights from the values above:
- The time to connect to NYC zone was 3x faster than the parent region, and 10x faster than the location far from the user
- The TTFB (`time_starttransfer`) was also 3 times faster than the parent region
- The total time to deliver close to the user was about 30% faster than the parent region
- The TTFB did not reported, but the server can be improved as the backend does some processing when calculating the GeoIP

### Benchmark Review

Let's move to the end of this benchmark by collecting more data points to normalize the results from the client and servers described above.

The script below tests each server and should be executed on **each client**:
```bash
run_batch() {
  URL="${1}"; shift
  LOC_SHORT="${1}"; shift
  LOCATION=$(curl -s ${URL} |jq -r ".clientInfo.geoIP | ( .countryCode + \"-\" + .region )")
  FILE_OUT="curl-batch_${LOCATION}-${LOC_SHORT}.txt"
  echo -e "\n ${URL}: " > tee -a ${FILE_OUT}
  curl_batch "${URL}" | tee -a ${FILE_OUT}
}

run_batch "${APP_URL_MAIN}" "main"
run_batch "${APP_URL_NYC}" "nyc"
run_batch "${APP_URL_MIA}" "mia"
```

You can find the raw files [here](https://github.com/mtulio/mtulio.labs/tree/master/labs/go-geo-app/data-benchmark).

Average in milliseconds:

| Client / Server | Main | NYC | MIA |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| BR-SC | 342.6579 | 352.2908 | 299.3756 |
| US-NY | 22.2609 | 16.0002 | 92.5647 |
| US-CA | 149.5462 | 152.1854 | 164.0881 |

Percentage comparing the parent region (negative is slower):
			
| Client / Server | Main | NYC | MIA |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| BR-SC | 0.00% | -2.81% | 12.63% |
| US-NY | 0.00% | 28.12% | -315.82% |
| US-CA | 0.00% | -1.76% | -9.72% |

Difference in `ms` between parent region  (negative is slower):

| Client / Server | Main | NYC | MIA |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| BR-SC	| 0 | -9.6329 | 43.2823 |
| US-NY	| 0 | 6.2607 | -70.3038 |
| US-CA | 0 | -2.6392 | -14.5419 |


## **Conclusion**

> TODO review and remove from original post

One of the biggest challenges to deliver solutions is to improve the application performance. This includes many layers, one of which is the infrastructure. Having an option to deliver low latency to the end-users with low code efforts is a big advantage in time to market.

There are points to improve like the limitation of infrastructure and the pricing. At the same time, if the demand grows more infrastructure can be provisioned and more options, services, and competitors could be available.

As we can see in the first part of this post, you can extend an existing OpenShift Cluster deployed with IPI to AWS Local Zones without any issues, then use an Application Load Balancer Operator to deliver the applications to the edge located in big cities.

Looking at the results of the benchmark, the improvement between the parent region is slightly high when the client is close to the Local Zone, otherwise, there's no benefit to delivering it as the resources will be more expensive on the edge compared to the parent zone.

Anyway, you can see how easy it is now to create modern Kubernetes applications with currently easy access to the edge networks.

Next topics to review:
- Use the [Route53 Geolocation routing policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html) to deliver a single endpoint to users. It's not a part of this research to check the precision can cover the distance between the Local Zone and parent region
- You can take advantage of ephemeral storage available on the most instances in Local Zones, so if you are processing files on the board, the disk IO will be extremely faster and the solution cheaper.
- Check the AWS Wavelength, one more opportunity to deliver low latency applications directly from RAN (Radio Access Networks) / 5G devices

If you would like to explore more any topic described here, feel free to leave a comment!

Thanks to reach the end of this research with me! :)
