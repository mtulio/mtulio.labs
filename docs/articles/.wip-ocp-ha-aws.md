# (WIP) Deploying High Scale OpenShift Cluster on AWS

The goal is to share the steps to use as day-02 IPI to deploy very densely keeping the high scalability and availability OpenShift cluster on AWS.

In most of scenarios when OpenShift deployed in a dense workloads with a large amount of nodes, the Control Plane needs to grow vertically scaling up to 5 nodes due the etcd quorum limitation. As there's a limitation of number of nodes, sometimes the vertical size are so high and expensive.


Some architectural goal when talking about scalability on Kubernetes clusters are:

- Offload the etcd cluster from Control Plane
- Split events objects (and other dense objects) from the main etcd cluster
- Scale up/down automatically the Control Plane
- Create workload groups using AWS ASG modern capabilities to balance the instance fleet between On-Demand and SPOT in different types


This post is splitted in a few parts by component:

- Part#0 - architecture overview and considerations
- Part#1 - offload etcd from Control Plane
- Part#2 - split events objects from main etcd cluster
- Part#3 - Auto scale Control Plane nodes
- Part#4 - Workload groups introduction
- Part#5 - Workload group: Infrastructure
- Part#6 - Workload group: Routers                              [Soon]
- Part#7 - Workload group: General pourpose services
- Part#8 - Workload group: Machine Learning services
- Part#9 - Workload group: Control Plane services (non-k8s)     [Soon]
- Part#10 - Workload group: ARM services                         [Soon]
- Part#11 - Final considerations
