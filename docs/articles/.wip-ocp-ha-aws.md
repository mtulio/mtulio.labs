# (WIP) Deploying High Scale OpenShift cluster on AWS

The goal is to share the steps to use as day-02 IPI to deploy very densely keeping the high scalability and availability OpenShift cluster on AWS.

In most of scenarios when OpenShift deployed in a dense workloads with a large amount of nodes, the Control Plane needs to grow vertically scaling up to 5 nodes due the etcd quorum limitation. As there's a limitation of number of nodes, sometimes the vertical size are so high and expensive.


Some architectural goal when talking about scalability on Kubernetes clusters are:

- Offload the etcd cluster from Control Plane
- Split events objects (and other dense objects) from the main etcd cluster
- Scale up/down automatically the Control Plane
- Create workload groups using AWS ASG modern capabilities to balance the instance fleet between On-Demand and SPOT in different types
