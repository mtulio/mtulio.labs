# OpenShift day-2 | Isolate etcd in a second disk

Idea / Goal:

- Install etcd in a second disk / isolated from root
- Installer will create the control plane in day-0, so there're two options to achieve that goal: 1) modify the installer; 2) replace masters with a second disk on MAPI (IPI)
- It could use different disks, including ephemeral ones, and at the end run quick performance tests to compare it
